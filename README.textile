Toolkit for use django with Google Cloud SQL in AppEngine

This project is inspired (forked) in the very google djangoappengine project.

h2. INSTALATION:

Basicaly setup a basic django project
copy or synlink the djangoappengine_rdbms to the root of your project. 
You should not install or put these files in the path beacuse they need to deployed to
appengine.

h2. SETUP: 

add the following line to your settings

pre. from djangoappengine_rdbms.settings_base import *

and configure you database. 

pre. DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'djangoappengine_rdbms.db.backend',
        'INSTANCE': 'djangosqlcloudmysql:example', 
        'NAME': 'example',                  # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
        'USER': 'root',                         # Not used with sqlite3.
        'PASSWORD': 'root',
    }
}



h2 .TODO:

# Make remote commands work - Google Cloud SQL does not use the stub services. Strategy: Access the directely the instance like the command line tool provided by Google
# write better instalations intructions
